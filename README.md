## Regarding Task Submission

After yesterday's session, we hope you are now comfortable with Git and GitHub. Now you will be given daily tasks on the basis of the topics taught on that particular day. You need to submit those tasks on Github. Your mentors will be providing you with the link of the repository they have created.

## Steps to submit the task:

Fork the repo
Make the new branch of your name in the repo.
Commit folder and files
Make pull request Similar to your day 1 task
Make a seperate folder for each task. That folder should contain all the files of that task. Follow folder name format.

The folder name of the task should be:

E.g. 2-7-2020_DS_Task-1_Nikita_Salunkhe

In this folder all files of the respective task. The best solution of the task will be published on TRF's GitHub profile. These tasks are a part of your continuous evaluation throughout the workshop Also, make sure that while submitting you submit the task on correct repo given by your mentor. All the best!
